<h1>Burglar Escape</h1>
<p>
My first completed game! A simple game written in Unity, which I've slowly been learning during the lock-down.
Before tackling anything serious, I knew I had to see through something super simple. The result is "Burglar Escape".
The goal is simple. You need to escape from the spotlight until the timer runs out.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>
In my Amiga days, I tried to self-learn Amos. This sparked a huge interest in finding game build in it, one of which was "The Great Escape of Billy Burglar".
A super simple game yet kept me entertained for ages.
