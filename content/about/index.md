## About Me

Just a guy who lives in the South of England working as a software developer with a ton of hobbies and interests.

Here you'll find things I write about - mostly [Software Development](/categories/development-blog/) and [my passion for learning Piano & Music Theory](/categories/music-blog/)

### Why does this exist?
I'm not sure but I mostly write here for my own enjoyment, reference and reflection. A couple of ex-colleagues I worked with ([Scott Wlaschin](https://scottwlaschin.com/) and [Matt Ball](https://stronglytyped.me/)) both who I admire greatly, suggested everyone should journal or write. After far too long, I've heeded their advice. If just  one person stumbles here and finds something useful then it's worth it.

### 👨🏻‍💻 Coding

I've developed software professionally since 2002, but as a hobby from around 10 years old. My journey began when my Nan introduced me to an Amstrad CPC 464, where I learned to write my name and address. From that moment, I was hooked! Later, I got my hands on an Amiga and discovered Amos and Blitz Basic - sparking a lifelong love for coding. Drawing and moving a box on a screen was magic back then, and it still is tbh!

### 🎹 Music

I'm an ungraded amateur pianist and guitarist but currently learning piano, theory and composition. I write [about my music learning journey](/categories/music-blog/) and [record my progress](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLboNyaCNE0vgtUk_j4TumMuSeGM5ALdSC) as I go. 

There are tons of excellent, professional musicians and teachers who put much better content than I'll ever be able to do. I'm not here showcasing brilliance (far, far form it), just documenting my own journey. The recordings of my playing and compositions I share are unpolished and unplanned, so apologies in advance for the quality.
