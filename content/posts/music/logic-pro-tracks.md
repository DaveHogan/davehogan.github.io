+++

I've been using **Logic Pro** to record MIDI output from my ES120 for a while now, but I've never played around with the sounds or creating layers. Throughout Feb, I gave myself the challenge of creating very small tracks / loops. Constraints: using the stock SFX and plugins, 30–60 minutes per track. They're nothing fancy, just ideas and experiments but I thought it would be nice to record and share them here so I can look back and cringe.

Both were produced and mixed in Logic Pro. If you have a minute (literally in most cases), have a listen below.

I recorded into Logic and played around with the 8-bit producer pack and constrained myself to only use those sounds. Using a total of 6 layers. It definitely gives me old video game vibes." >}}

More to be added throughout February!

## How they were made

These started as simple ideas. A loop, a chord progression, or a beat which grew from there. Logic Pro made it straightforward to layer parts, tweak sounds, and get something that felt finished enough to export.

I'm still very much an absolute beginner when it comes to music production and Logic Pro. These are very much “for fun” rather than polished releases or anything serious. I hope to improve as I understand music production and Logic more.

I've also got my hands on an Akai MPK Mini MIDI controller but have yet to try it out. At this point I think I need an audio interface, but that's for another time.

If there is any interest, you're best looking up actual real producers on YouTube, but if it helps, I can share my Logic Project files. If you're into making music in Logic or similar tools, I’d be keen to hear what you're working on too, or if you have any useful advice.
