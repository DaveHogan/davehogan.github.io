I've been a life long consumer of music and I love pretty much all genres. Music really hits me emotionally. 
I love live music, blessed with the Isle of Wight Festival and the local music scene here, and visited many orchestras and music venues over the years.

Despite this, as a kid, I never really ___explored___ music. I just consumed it. I had a school borrowed acoustic guitar for a few weeks but that was it.
Then something prompted an impulse purchase of a guitar for myself when I was 25. I was a typical noob but did eventually get weekly lessons with local guitarist [Matt Kellett](http://www.mattkellett.com/mattkellett/biography.html). 

Through no fault of Matt though, I never got the most basic of music theory or sheet reading. 
I guess, like most beginners, I just wanted to noodle around and play songs that I wasn't ready for. 
I got as far as strumming chords, 12-bar blues and learning a few songs from memory and reading tab. 
In hindsight, I should have stuck with the guitar and music reading / theory but eventually progress slowed and interest waned after a couple of years. I do still play the guitar now and again but wouldn't say I've progressed in a number of years.

## Piano entered the chat
In a strange turn of events, my wife was offered an old upright piano as she was interested in learning to play. It took her some convincing ***ME*** that we should take it.
After I conceded, it arrived July 2023 and I fell in love almost **immediately**.

It wasn't long before I "_needed_" a better piano. I decided on the Kawai ES120 digital piano. An amazing entry level digital piano in my opinion. The digital piano had the same action and feel as the old upright but with a much better sound and the added benefit of being able to play it at unsocial hours with headphones.

Like most beginners, and as I did previously with the guitar, I started learning a few things via Youtube and doing the easy thing of watching Synthesia videos.
Synthesia is similar to Tablature but with a piano. It's a useful tool by helping you visualise what to play without having to read sheet music. However it can be a crutch and eventually slow you down.

I wanted more progress and I wanted to make sure I was learning the "correct way". At this point I was about 15 months into learning the piano and I decided I should go down the formal training route and higher a tutor. I wanted to learn how to read sheet music and maybe even get a grade. Regardless on whether this was a passing hobby, learning to read sheet music would be beneficial for future instruments and just a good skill to have.

In October 2024, I took up in-person lessons with Roger from [Isle Teach Piano](https://isleteachpiano.co.uk/) and I've been enjoying it. Very humbled going back to the most basic of music to actually be able to learn and study a piece. In the last 3 months, I've been a few grade 1 pieces and now working my way through a couple of grade 2 pieces. I like the variety of pieces and the challenge of learning them, the different styles and the different techniques. Things I wouldn't have got self-taught. So... lots of preamble for essentially to only say follow my journey, if you'd like, on YouTube playlist below.

If you're interested in my piano journey and want to see my progress then this is the playlist where I plan to record my progress.
I wish I recorded my progress more regularly and hope to do so more in the future. It's an important strategy to see where you're at and how you're progressing.
I really recommend recording your progress in anything you do. I've found sharing with others is a great way to keep you motivated and get feedback.

The Facebook group [**Adult Piano Beginners**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1114361552240767) is a great place to share your progress too. 
I posted here for the first time recently and received some really good feedback on my posture.

### End Goal?
I'm not a natural, I probably won't **ever** been a good pianist. I'm just a guy who loves music and wants to play the piano. I enjoy learning and will aim to take grades in the future for both theory and practical. There is no end goal or unrealistic achievements. Just having fun.
