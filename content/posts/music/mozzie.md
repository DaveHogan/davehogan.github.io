I've been away from recording progress recently but despite that, I have been keeping up with my Piano practice and learning. My excuse for not recording is mainly due to the jump in complexity from Grade 1 to 2. I'm also concurrently working on three pieces, Mozzie (this), Écossaise in G and Moderato since I last posted [Anglefish](/posts/music/angelfish-anne-crosby-gaudet).

Here's where I'm at with it so far.

## The Journey
After "completing" [Angelfish](/posts/music/angelfish-anne-crosby-gaudet) this was a much bigger jump for me. It's much faster, funky and jazzy rhythm and plently of articulations to get right. 

The piece introduced me to several new concepts:
- Grace notes
- Jazz style
- Articulations of the accents (particularly on beat 3) - I've struggled to get this right

*Sheet music for this piece can typically be found in the ABRSM Piano Exam Pieces books for 2023/24. Unfortunately it's not available on Musescore, assuming because of copyright*

## Reflection
I've enjoyed learning this as it's completely different to everything I've learnt so far. The jazzy sound and change in dynamics was fun and challenging too. 
I always feel like there is more to do to get it sounding right though. I'm happy enough with my progress with this now and let it take a back seat 

## What's Next?

I've made good progress on Écossaise in G and aim to upload a recording of that soon. Moderato I'm still trying to remember the notes and get over the tricky bars 6 & 7. Both are attributed to Beethoven I've surprised myself how much I enjoy these.
