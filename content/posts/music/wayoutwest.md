I'm sharing my final piece from the ABRSM syllabus Grade 2 titled **Way Out West** by Peter Letanka.

Here's the performance:

## The Journey

This piece kept me really busy! I spent way longer on this than any other piece so far.

The tempo is quite quick at 116bpm but with a "rolling lazy" feel in 6/8 timing. Bars 17-24 feel entirely different and I still struggle with this sounding right. It's a complete contrast switch but the piece is great fun and unique to play. Unfortunately the sheet music is copyrighted and therefore only available to purchase. The ABRSM 2025/6 exam books contain it should you wish to read it.

## What's Next?
This concludes my Grade 2 journey and I have been working on Grade 3 pieces alongside Way Out West. These are titled, I'll Take Les and Tarantella Twist. Both of these pieces are very different and I'm making steady progress on them. I hope to share these as soon as I'm able to play them throughout without too many mistakes or dynamic issues.
