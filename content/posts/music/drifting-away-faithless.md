I've just come back from an amazing weekend at the [Isle of Wight Festival 2025](https://isleofwightfestival.com/). I watched Faithless played on the Friday night (20th June) which was an incredible end of the night on the main stage. During the set, I was struck by an old song I haven't heard for years with a great melody. I actually think I've heard the Paradiso Remix version before and not the actual song. Anyway the song is called  "Drifting Away" which has this cool repetitive piano melody. Now I'm back in the land of living today, I went off to YouTube to find how to play it, but I couldn't find any sheet music or video tutorials.

So I gave it a go and wrote my own arrangement which I hope is close to the original. I figured it was 130 BPM or thereabouts and has a Bb so I'm assuming it's in the key of F or Dm.

There's something about that melody that just sticks with you - it's very simple yet highly impactful. The way it simple and repetitive yet carries on is quite beautiful.

## The Arrangement Process

I used [MuseScore](https://musescore.com/) to score out the arrangement, which is published here: [Drifting Away - Faithless Piano Cover](https://musescore.com/user/69379000/scores/25963549?share=copy_link)
