It's that time of year when Piano practicing includes something a bit more seasonal. My tutor gave me a basic arrangement of this classic Christmas song, which is something completely different to what I've previously learnt.

I didn't manage to get this polished for the holidays but it's at least recognisable. I learnt various chords studying this piece and used the pedal. I'm still learning and trying to remember lifting between chord changes. This sheet music has no pedal markers or fingering which was great for studying and coming up with what I felt worked for me.

Here's the *unpolished* performance. I would have liked another week on this to improve this but Christmas is in a few days and I want to wrap this piece up for now.

## What's Next?
I've been absent from posting or creating YouTube recently but I have a few ABRSM grade 2 and 3 pieces nearing completion. Over the holidays I hope to "complete" these and share my progress.
